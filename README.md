# FTImageViewer

FTImageViewer. A simple ImageViewer and ImageGrid. Can preview images with just a few lines of code. 

I wrote this for my future projects. Feel free to try it in your own projects!

The project is now finished. But more feathers are coming. 

I wish I had time to upload a JIF to show you how amazing this is.


##Usage


```swift

	FTImageViewer.sharedInstance.showImages(imageUrlArray, atIndex: buttonIndex , fromSenderArray: buttonArray)

```
